# Sales Prediction Using Python

## Description:-

This project demonstrates the process of predicting sales based on advertising expenditures using machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to leverage various advertising channels (TV, Newspaper, Radio) to forecast sales and optimize advertising strategies.

## Introduction:-

Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions about their advertising budget allocation. By analyzing historical data, we can build predictive models to estimate future sales. This project uses linear regression to create a model that predicts sales based on the amount spent on TV, Newspaper, and Radio advertisements.

## Dataset:-

The dataset (`advertising.csv`) contains the following columns:
- **TV**: Advertising expenditure on TV
- **Newspaper**: Advertising expenditure on Newspapers
- **Radio**: Advertising expenditure on Radio
- **Sales**: Sales figures
  
## Steps:-

### 1. Import Libraries-
Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### 2. Load the Data-
Load the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

### 3. Explore the Data-
Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, including summary statistics and visualizations.

### 4. Visualize Relationships Between Variables-
Create scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize the relationships between the advertising expenditures and sales.

### 5. Prepare the Data-
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 6. Build the Model-
Use linear regression to build a predictive model.

### 7. Evaluate the Model-
Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

### 8. Visualize Predictions-
Plot the actual vs. predicted sales to visualize the model's accuracy.

## Dependencies:-

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

## Conclusion:-

This project demonstrates how to use Python for sales prediction based on advertising expenditures. By performing EDA, visualizing data, and building a linear regression model, we can gain insights into the relationships between different advertising channels and sales. This approach helps businesses optimize their advertising strategies to maximize sales.
